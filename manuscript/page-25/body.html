<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">your happy England into foure,
Whereof, take you one quarter into France,
And you withall shall make all Gallia shake. 
If we with thrice such powers left at home,
Cannot defend our owne doores from the dogge,
Let vs be worried, and our Nation lose
The name of hardinesse and policie</p><p>King.  Call in the Messengers sent from the Dolphin. 
Now are we well resolu'd, and by Gods helpe
And yours, the noble sinewes of our power,
France being ours, wee'l bend it to our Awe,
Or breake it all to peeces.  Or there wee'l sit,
(Ruling in large and ample Emperie,
Ore France, and all her (almost Kingly Dukedomes))</p><p>Or lay these bones in an vnworthy Vrne,
Tomblesse, with no remembrance ouer them:
Either our History shall with full mouth
Speake freely of our Acts, or else our graue
Like Turkish mute, shall haue a tonguelesse mouth,
Not worshipt with a waxen Epitaph. 
Enter Ambassadors of France.</p></div> </div>
