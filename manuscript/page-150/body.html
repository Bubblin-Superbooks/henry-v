It is the Souldiers: I by bargaine should
Weare it my selfe.  Follow good Cousin Warwick:
If that the Souldier strike him, as I iudge

And toucht with Choler, hot as Gunpowder,
And quickly will returne an iniurie.

you now, come apace to the King: there is more good
toward you peraduenture, then is in your knowledge to

Flu.  Know the Gloue? I know the Gloue is a Gloue</p></div> </div>
