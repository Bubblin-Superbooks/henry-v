his Prayers, lest a should be thought a Coward: but his
few bad Words are matcht with as few good Deeds; for
a neuer broke any mans Head but his owne, and that was
against a Post, when he was drunke.  They will steale any
thing, and call it Purchase.  Bardolph stole a Lute-case,
bore it twelue Leagues, and sold it for three halfepence. 
Nim and Bardolph are sworne Brothers in filching: and
in Callice they stole a fire-shouell.  I knew by that peece

or their Hand-kerchers: which makes much against my
Manhood, if I should take from anothers Pocket, to put
into mine; for it is plaine pocketting vp of Wrongs. 
I must leaue them, and seeke some better Seruice: their
Villany goes against my weake stomacke, and therefore
I must cast it vp.
