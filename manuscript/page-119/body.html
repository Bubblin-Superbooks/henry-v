Possesse them not with feare: Take from them now
The sence of reckning of th' opposed numbers:
Pluck their hearts from them.  Not to day, O Lord,

My Father made, in compassing the Crowne. 
I Richards body haue interred new,
And on it haue bestowed more contrite teares,
Then from it issued forced drops of blood.
