the Bridge?
Flu.  I assure you, there is very excellent Seruices committed
at the Bridge</p><p>Gower.  Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
Flu.  The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon,
and a man that I loue and honour with my soule,
and my heart, and my dutie, and my liue, and my liuing,
and my vttermost power.  He is not, God be praysed and
blessed, any hurt in the World, but keepes the Bridge
most valiantly, with excellent discipline.  There is an aunchient
Lieutenant there at the Pridge, I thinke in my very
conscience hee is as valiant a man as Marke Anthony, and
hee is a man of no estimation in the World, but I did see
him doe as gallant seruice</p><p>Gower.  What doe you call him?
Flu.  Hee is call'd aunchient Pistoll</p><p>Gower.  I know him not. 
Enter Pistoll.</p><p>Flu.  Here is the man</p></div> </div>
