In little roome confining mightie men,
Mangling by starts the full course of their glory. 
Small time: but in that small, most greatly liued
This Starre of England.  Fortune made his Sword;
By which, the Worlds best Garden he atchieued:
And of it left his Sonne Imperiall Lord. 
Henry the Sixt, in Infant Bands crown'd King
Of France and England, did this King succeed:
Whose State so many had the managing,
That they lost France, and made his England bleed:
Which oft our Stage hath showne; and for their sake,
In your faire minds let this acceptance take.</p><p>FINIS.  The Life of Henry the Fift.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
