Their ragged Curtaines poorely are let loose,
And our Ayre shakes them passing scornefully. 
Bigge Mars seemes banqu'rout in their begger'd Hoast,
And faintly through a rustie Beuer peepes. 
The Horsemen sit like fixed Candlesticks,
With Torch-staues in their hand: and their poore Iades
Lob downe their heads, dropping the hides and hips:
The gumme downe roping from their pale-dead eyes,
And in their pale dull mouthes the Iymold Bitt
Lyes foule with chaw'd-grasse, still and motionlesse. 
And their executors, the knauish Crowes,
Flye o're them all, impatient for their howre.
