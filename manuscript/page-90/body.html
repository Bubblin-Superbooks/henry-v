<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">were in health, I tell thee Herald,
I thought, vpon one payre of English Legges
Did march three Frenchmen.  Yet forgiue me God,
That I doe bragge thus; this your ayre of France
Hath blowne that vice in me.  I must repent:
Goe therefore tell thy Master, heere I am;
My Ransome, is this frayle and worthlesse Trunke;
My Army, but a weake and sickly Guard:
Yet God before, tell him we will come on,
Though France himselfe, and such another Neighbor
Stand in our way.  There's for thy labour Mountioy. 
Goe bid thy Master well aduise himselfe. 
If we may passe, we will: if we be hindred,
We shall your tawnie ground with your red blood
Discolour: and so Mountioy, fare you well. 
The summe of all our Answer is but this:
We would not seeke a Battaile as we are,
Nor as we are, we say we will not shun it:
So tell your Master</p><p>Mount.  I shall deliuer so: Thankes to your Highnesse</p></div> </div>
