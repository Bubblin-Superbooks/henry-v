My Cousin Westmerland.  No, my faire Cousin:
If we are markt to dye, we are enow
To doe our Countrey losse: and if to liue,
The fewer men, the greater share of honour. 
Gods will, I pray thee wish not one man more. 
By Ioue, I am not couetous for Gold,
Nor care I who doth feed vpon my cost:
It yernes me not, if men my Garments weare;
Such outward things dwell not in my desires. 
But if it be a sinne to couet Honor,
I am the most offending Soule</p></div> </div>
