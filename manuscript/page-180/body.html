Deare Kate, you and I cannot bee confin'd within the
weake Lyst of a Countreyes fashion: wee are the makers
of Manners, Kate; and the libertie that followes
our Places, stoppes the mouth of all finde-faults, as I
will doe yours, for vpholding the nice fashion of your
Countrey, in denying me a Kisse: therefore patiently,
and yeelding.  You haue Witch-craft in your Lippes,
Kate: there is more eloquence in a Sugar touch of
them, then in the Tongues of the French Councell; and
they should sooner perswade Harry of England, then a
generall Petition of Monarchs.  Heere comes your
Father. 
Enter the French Power, and the English Lords.</p><p>Burg.  God saue your Maiestie, my Royall Cousin,
teach you our Princesse English?
King.  I would haue her learne, my faire Cousin, how
perfectly I loue her, and that is good English</p></div> </div>
