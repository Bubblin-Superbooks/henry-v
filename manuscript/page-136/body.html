Be these the wretches that we plaid at dice for?
Orl.  Is this the King we sent too, for his ransome?
Bur.  Shame, and eternall shame, nothing but shame,
Let vs dye in once more backe againe,
And he that will not follow Burbon now,
Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand
Like a base Pander hold the Chamber doore,
Whilst a base slaue, no gentler then my dogge,
His fairest daughter is contaminated</p><p>Con.  Disorder that hath spoyl'd vs, friend vs now,
Let vs on heapes go offer vp our liues</p><p>Orl.  We are enow yet liuing in the Field,
To smother vp the English in our throngs,
If any order might be thought vpon</p><p>Bur.  The diuell take Order now, Ile to the throng;
Let life be short, else shame will be too long.
