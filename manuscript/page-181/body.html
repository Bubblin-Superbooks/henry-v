King.  Our Tongue is rough, Coze, and my Condition
is not smooth: so that hauing neyther the Voyce nor
the Heart of Flatterie about me, I cannot so coniure vp
the Spirit of Loue in her, that hee will appeare in his true
likenesse</p><p>Burg.  Pardon the franknesse of my mirth, if I answer
you for that.  If you would coniure in her, you must
make a Circle: if coniure vp Loue in her in his true
likenesse, hee must appeare naked, and blinde.  Can you
blame her then, being a Maid, yet ros'd ouer with the
Virgin Crimson of Modestie, if shee deny the apparance
of a naked blinde Boy in her naked seeing selfe? It were
(my Lord a hard Condition for a Maid to consigne)</p><p>to</p><p>King.  Yet they doe winke and yeeld, as Loue is blind
and enforces</p><p>Burg.  They are then excus'd, my Lord, when they see
not what they doe</p></div> </div>
