Mountioy.  My Masters mind</p><p>King.  Vnfold it</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Mountioy.  Thus sayes my King: Say thou to Harry
of England, Though we seem'd dead, we did but sleepe:
Aduantage is a better Souldier then rashnesse.  Tell him,

and admire our sufferance.  Bid him therefore consider
of his ransome, which must proportion the losses we
haue borne, the subiects we haue lost, the disgrace we
haue digested; which in weight to re-answer, his pettinesse
would bow vnder. </p></div> </div>
