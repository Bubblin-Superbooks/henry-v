And in a Captiue Chariot, into Roan
Bring him our Prisoner</p><p>Const.  This becomes the Great. 
Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
His Souldiers sick, and famisht in their March:
For I am sure, when he shall see our Army,
Hee'le drop his heart into the sinck of feare,
And for atchieuement, offer vs his Ransome</p><p>King.  Therefore Lord Constable, hast on Montioy,
And let him say to England, that we send,
To know what willing Ransome he will giue. 
Prince Dolphin, you shall stay with vs in Roan</p><p>Dolph.  Not so, I doe beseech your Maiestie</p><p>King.  Be patient, for you shall remaine with vs. 
Now forth Lord Constable, and Princes all,
And quickly bring vs word of Englands fall.</p><p>Exeunt.</p><p>Enter Captaines, English and Welch, Gower and Fluellen.</p></div> </div>
